\section{Future Scope}

The study in general could be improved by introducing metrics for the evaluation of the different controllers considered. Towards the end, we realized that our work is too qualitative. \\

Similarly, the study can be improved by designing the PID and FL controllers more rigorously. For the PID controllers, tuning could be done by employing genetic algorithms, or even by optimally solving for the controller transfer function. We realized towards the end that we had enough information for doing so. \\

As for the Fuzzy Logic Controllers, they could be improved by choosing all the parameters more carefully. The parameters include the number of sets defined, the membership functions' widths and shapes. The parameters could have been selected better if the big picture was kept in mind. In general, the FLC could have been designed with more inputs, such as the rate of change of error, or the accumulation of the error in the output. \\
