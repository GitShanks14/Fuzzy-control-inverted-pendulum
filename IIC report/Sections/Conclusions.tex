\section{Conclusions}

1. PID > FLC under normal conditions
2. large number of sets + customized gains -> smooth / intricate controller, which could outperform PID

\section{Learning Outcomes}

We learnt how to model simple systems on MATLAB, be it linear or non-linear. We learnt how to stabilize unstable systems with both PID and fuzzy logic control. All three of us were new to fuzzy logic, and in general learnt a lot about how things work. Though we didn't get to implement everything that we learnt, we learnt a lot through this project. \\

Things we were looking forward to learn but couldn't due to time constraints include standard techniques for tuning PID for unstable systems, how to design fuzzy logic controllers properly for such systems, and multi-input fuzzy logic controllers for the same. Advanced topics that we only glanced at include adaptive or fuzzy PID controllers, and neural networks for the control of such systems.
