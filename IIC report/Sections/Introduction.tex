\section{Introduction}

When one is asked to think of stabilization problems, inverted pendulum systems are among the first to come to mind. Inverted pendulums are a simple and common example of systems that can be at an unstable equilibrium. Why would we want to study such a system? We would like to, because more complex systems of interest, such as rockets right after launch, and the hoverboard (2-wheeled self-balancing scooter) also involve similar stabilization problems. \\

The aim of this study is to simulate and visualize the inverted pendulum system, and observe the actions and performances of fuzzy logic controllers with respect to PID controllers. The differential equations stemming from the inverted pendulum system, a PID controller and a fuzzy logic controller were all implemented using MATLAB. Code was also written to visualize the pendulum system in the form of a video. \\

MATLAB was used, and not Simulink or LabView. This was because the goal of the study was to explore the fundamentals of both PID and fuzzy logic controllers. The MATLAB programming environment allowed for more flexibly visualize the system as a video, as well as allowed for tinkering of the system. Implementing the fuzzy logic controller from scratch allowed for a better understanding of the same than the use of a block diagram implementation.
